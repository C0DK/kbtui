# Welcome to [kbtui](https://keybase.io/team/kbtui)! 
An application for those who want to use Keybase, but don't want to leave the comfort of their terminal. 

## Basic Rules
Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project! There are two main rules:
* Don't be rude
* Keep it simple, stupid

There is nothing to be gained by being rude anywhere; contributions to this project are no different. 
Also when in doubt, simplify everything. There are other people who are reading, forking, and working on this project. 
See the style guidelines below in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.

## Pull Requests
In order for a PR to be accepted it must be two things:
* Reviewed by [@dxb](https://keybase.io/dxb) or [@rudi9719](https://keybase.io/rudi9719)
* Consistent with the Go formatting guidelines below.

# Getting Started!
Please read through [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html]) and [Style guidelines for go](https://rakyll.org/style-packages/).
If you're having difficulties getting started I suggest you try to [learn go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests).

It might also help to read the godoc for [@dxb's Keybase framework](https://godoc.org/samhofi.us/x/keybase),
as well as the godoc for [gocui](https://godoc.org/github.com/awesome-gocui/gocui), the library we're using for the TUI.
Please note, we're using the awesome-gocui version of gocui.
